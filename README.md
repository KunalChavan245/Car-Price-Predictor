# Car-Price-Predictor

In this mini project, I have used the Linear Regression algorithm to Predict the Price of the Car on the basis of various factors like Car Model, Car Company, etc. The Efficiency of My Linear Regression Model  (R2 Score) is 0.85 which is okay as I have used a small amount of data (1000 car data).
